conceptests
===========

This is a repository for concept test ideas; one website explaining some of the background to ConcepTests is here: http://math.arizona.edu/~lomen/conceptests.html.   A great example of the use of ConcepTests is the Instructors manual on ConcepTests for Deborah Hughes-Hallet et al book on calculus (the ConcepTest manual has ISBN: 978-1-118-22664-3   

This repository is hopefully the start of another question bank in different topic areas.   It was initiated following a HEA sponsored event at Plymouth University in May 2014.

There are subfolders indicating topic areas.   Contributions are welcome.
